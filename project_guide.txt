# Technical Specification for Multi-Step Forecasting Model with Dynamic Anchor Variables and Multi-Frequency Adjustments

## Objective

Build an econometric model to forecast vehicle sales using a multi-step, hierarchical approach that:
1. Dynamically selects optimal anchor variables based on statistical criteria, rather than relying solely on GDP growth
2. Handles discrepancies in time aggregation between target variables (monthly) and explanatory variables (quarterly/annually)

## Step 1: Dynamic Selection of Anchor Variables

Rather than hardcoding GDP growth as the anchor variable, the model will dynamically select the most relevant economic indicators:
- Potential anchors include GDP growth, Federal Funds Rate (FFR), Inflation Rate (CPI), Consumer Confidence Index (CCI)
- Selection criteria:
  - Granger causality tests
  - Information criteria (AIC, BIC)
  - Forecasting accuracy metrics (RMSE, MAE)
  - Economic domain knowledge

## Step 2: Two-Stage Forecasting Process

### First Stage: Intermediate Variable Forecasting
- Use the selected anchor variables to forecast intermediate economic variables
- Apply dimension reduction (PCA) to handle multicollinearity and reduce computational complexity
- Align different frequencies using temporal disaggregation techniques

### Second Stage: Target Variable Forecasting
- Train multiple model types on the target variable (vehicle sales)
- Select the best performing model based on validation metrics
- Use the forecasted intermediate variables as inputs to predict the target

## Step 3: Multi-Frequency Data Handling

- Handle different data frequencies (monthly, quarterly, annual)
- Apply techniques like:
  - Temporal disaggregation (Denton method)
  - Mixed Data Sampling (MIDAS) models
  - Frequency alignment methods

## Step 4: Hierarchical Consistency

- Ensure forecasts are consistent across different aggregation levels
- Apply hierarchical reconciliation methods:
  - Bottom-up approach
  - Top-down approach
  - Optimal combination methods

## Step 5: Evaluation and Validation

- Use time-series cross-validation
- Compare model performance against naive benchmarks
- Evaluate robustness across different economic scenarios
- Assess coherence of hierarchical forecasts

## Implementation Framework

- Modular architecture with separate components for:
  - Data access and preprocessing
  - Anchor variable selection
  - Model training and evaluation
  - Forecasting and visualization
- Scalable approach that allows for easy updates as new data becomes available

This architecture provides a flexible economic forecasting system that leverages optimal anchor variables and handles multi-frequency data to produce accurate and consistent forecasts.
