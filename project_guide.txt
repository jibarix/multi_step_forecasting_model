# **Technical Specification for 12-Month Vehicle Sales Forecasting Model Anchored on GDP Growth**  

## **Objective**  

Develop an econometric forecasting model for **12-month ahead vehicle sales projections** using a structured, multi-step process that:  

1. **Uses GDP growth as the anchor variable**, incorporating:  
   - **GDPNow** (Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta) for real-time quarterly nowcasts.  
   - **Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projections** for long-term GDP growth forecasts.  
   - These quarterly forecasts serve as the **primary economic drivers** of the vehicle sales model.  

2. **Converts quarterly GDP forecasts to monthly values**, ensuring smooth integration into a monthly forecasting model.  

3. **Forecasts intermediate economic variables** (e.g., employment, disposable income) at a monthly level based on projected GDP growth.  

4. **Generates a 12-month ahead vehicle sales forecast**, ensuring hierarchical consistency and temporal coherence.

## **Step 1: Input Preparation and Temporal Disaggregation**  

### **Quarterly GDP Forecasts as Inputs**  
- The model takes as input:  
  - **GDPNow** real-time quarterly nowcasts.  
  - **CBO long-term GDP projections** (quarterly frequency).  
- These forecasts drive the projection of **intermediate economic indicators** and ultimately vehicle sales.  

### **Temporal Disaggregation to Monthly Frequency**  
- Since GDP data is **quarterly**, the model applies **state-of-the-art disaggregation techniques** to convert it into monthly values:  
  - **Denton proportional adjustment method** (widely used by statistical agencies for aligning quarterly-to-monthly data).  
  - **Chow-Lin regression-based interpolation**, where additional monthly indicators (e.g., industrial production, employment) guide the distribution.  
  - **Mixed Data Sampling (MIDAS) regression**, if high-frequency leading indicators are available.  
- The chosen method ensures **consistency across different time horizons** while preserving key economic patterns.

## **Step 2: Forecasting Intermediate Economic Indicators**  

- Based on the **disaggregated monthly GDP forecasts**, the model projects **other key macroeconomic indicators**, such as:  
  - **Employment rates**  
  - **Consumer spending / disposable income**  
  - **Interest rates (Federal Funds Rate, Treasury yields)**  
  - **Inflation (CPI, PPI)**  
- This step ensures that all necessary inputs are at a **monthly frequency**, ready for vehicle sales forecasting.  

- **Techniques Used:**  
  - **Vector autoregression (VAR)**: Models interactions between GDP and economic indicators.  
  - **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Reduces dimensionality and avoids multicollinearity.  
  - **Error correction models (ECM)**: Adjusts short-term predictions based on long-term GDP trends.

## **Step 3: Forecasting Monthly Vehicle Sales**  

- Once **monthly macroeconomic indicators** are forecasted, they are used to project **vehicle sales** at a 12-month horizon.  
- The forecasting model is trained on historical data using various techniques:  
  - **Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)** with exogenous variables (ARIMAX).  
  - **Gradient Boosting Methods (XGBoost, LightGBM)** for capturing non-linear relationships.  
  - **Neural Networks (LSTMs, RNNs)** if long-term dependencies are found in sales patterns.  
- The best-performing model is **selected based on validation metrics** (RMSE, MAE).

## **Step 4: Ensuring Hierarchical Consistency**  

- Forecasts must be **consistent across different levels** (e.g., regional vs. national sales, car segments).  
- The model applies **hierarchical reconciliation techniques**, including:  
  - **Bottom-up approach**: Aggregates segment-level forecasts into a national total.  
  - **Top-down approach**: Disaggregates total sales into regional/segment forecasts.  
  - **MinT (Minimum Trace) reconciliation**: Ensures optimal alignment across levels.

## **Step 5: Model Evaluation and Validation**  

- **Time-Series Cross-Validation:** Rolling-origin forecast validation ensures model robustness.  
- **Benchmarking Against Naïve Models:** Model performance is compared against:  
  - **Last year’s sales trend (seasonal naive benchmark).**  
  - **GDP growth correlation-based naive models.**  
- **Scenario Analysis:** Model is stress-tested against economic downturns and recessions.

## **Implementation Framework**  

- **Modular, scalable architecture** to support continuous updates as new GDP forecasts are released.  
- **Automated data pipeline** for ingesting GDPNow and CBO projections.  
- **Flexible model selection framework**, allowing for adaptive improvements as more data becomes available.
