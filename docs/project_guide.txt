# **Technical Specification for Vehicle Sales Forecasting Model with Hybrid GDP Anchoring**  

## **Objective**  

The purpose of this econometric model is to forecast vehicle sales using a multi-step, hierarchical approach that:

1. **Anchors on the growth rate of real Gross Domestic Product (GDP)** as measured by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) and forecasted using:
   - **User-provided quarterly GDP projections** in a standardized format
   - Support for inputs from multiple methodologies, including GDPNow and Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projections
   - A flexible framework that adapts to different forecast horizons based on provided quarters

2. **Implements a hybrid modeling system** that:
   - Applies both **dimensionality reduction techniques** and **individual variable models**
   - Captures correlated movements in economic indicators through principal component analysis
   - Groups similar variables through clustering to balance complexity and interpretability
   - Maintains individual models for key indicators with unique GDP relationships

3. **Handles discrepancies in time aggregation** where:
   - Vehicle sales data is available monthly
   - GDP and some explanatory variables are provided quarterly
   - Advanced temporal disaggregation techniques align these different frequencies

4. **Employs a two-tier forecasting process** where:
   - Tier 1: GDP projections drive intermediate economic indicator forecasts
   - Tier 2: These indicators inform the vehicle sales forecast model
   - Optimal feature selection occurs between transformed and raw variables

5. **Ensures hierarchical consistency** across different aggregation levels through:
   - Reconciliation methods for temporal coherence
   - Consistency checks across related variables
   - Structured error propagation for realistic confidence intervals

## **System Architecture**

### **Two-Tier Modeling System**

The forecasting system consists of two interconnected but independently updatable models:

1. **GDP-Anchored Variable Models (Tier 1)**
   - Transform user-provided GDP projections into forecasts for economic indicators
   - Can be updated independently as new economic data becomes available
   - Utilizes dimension reduction, clustering, and individual modeling approaches

2. **Target Variable Prediction Model (Tier 2)**
   - Uses outputs from Tier 1 as inputs to predict the target variable (e.g., auto sales)
   - Automatically selects optimal features from both transformed and raw variables
   - Employs advanced machine learning techniques (LightGBM, ensembles)

### **Data Flow**

```
User GDP Projections → Temporal Disaggregation → GDP-Anchored Models → 
Variable Forecasts → Target Model → Sales Forecast
```

## **Step 1: GDP Processing and Temporal Disaggregation**  

### **GDP Projection Inputs**  
- The system accepts quarterly GDP projections in a standardized format:
  - `YYYY.Q: X.X` (e.g., `2025.1: -1.8, 2025.2: 2.0`)
  - These projections define the forecast horizon and scenario

### **Temporal Disaggregation Methods**  
- Converts quarterly GDP projections to monthly values using:
  - **Chow-Lin regression-based method** that maintains quarterly totals while distributing to months
  - **Denton proportional adjustment** for smoother transitions
  - **State-space models** for incorporating related monthly indicators

## **Step 2: GDP-Anchored Variable Modeling**  

### **Dimension Reduction Approach**
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** to capture correlated movements across economic variables
- Models are built to predict principal components from GDP growth
- Component predictions are transformed back to original variable space
- Benefits: noise reduction, fewer models to maintain, captures cross-correlations

### **Clustering Approach**
- Groups similar economic variables using hierarchical or k-means clustering
- One model per cluster predicts representative variables based on GDP
- Within-cluster relationships estimate remaining variables
- Benefits: balance between complexity and interpretability

### **Individual Variable Models**
- Direct GDP-to-variable models for key economic indicators
- Captures unique relationships not well-represented in reduced dimensions
- Benefits: highest interpretability, handles non-linear relationships

### **Hybrid Model Selection**
- Automated evaluation determines best approach for each variable:
  - Time series cross-validation to select modeling approach
  - Ensemble methods to combine predictions when beneficial
  - Weighting based on historical accuracy

---

## **Step 3: Target Variable Prediction**  

### **Feature Selection Framework**
- Dynamic selection between:
  - Principal components from dimension reduction
  - Cluster-based variable forecasts
  - Individual variable forecasts
- Feature importance analysis identifies key drivers of target variable
- Regularization techniques prevent overfitting

### **Advanced Modeling Techniques**
- **LightGBM Gradient Boosting** (top performer in M5 competition)
- **Temporal hierarchical reconciliation** for consistency across time periods
- **Ensemble methods** combining multiple models
- **Cross-learning** from related time series when available

---

## **Step 4: Forecast Generation and Analysis**  

### **Scenario Analysis**
- Generate multiple forecasts based on different GDP projection scenarios
- Sensitivity analysis to understand GDP elasticity of sales
- Confidence intervals reflect model and input uncertainty

### **Model Evaluation**
- Time series cross-validation with expanding windows
- Benchmarking against naive forecasts and industry standards
- Out-of-sample testing on held-out periods

### **Visualization and Reporting**
- Interactive dashboards for forecast exploration
- Drill-down capabilities for understanding drivers
- Export functionality for integration with business systems
