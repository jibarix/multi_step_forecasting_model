# Advancements in Retail Forecasting (2018–2023)

In the last five years, numerous studies by academics, government agencies, and industry researchers have explored ways to improve retail forecasting. This includes research on forecasting methods in retail operations, evaluations of macroeconomic forecast anchors (like the Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow and CBO projections), techniques for converting quarterly economic data to monthly estimates, and advances in modeling unit-level retail sales. Below is a summary of key findings and case studies in each of these areas, with an emphasis on peer-reviewed studies, government reports, and institutional research.

## Retail Forecasting Methodologies: Case Studies and Evidence

Retail demand forecasting has seen rapid methodological development, driven by new data sources and unprecedented market changes. One notable trend is the rise of omni-channel retail (integrating online and offline sales), which introduces new complexity. Researchers note that linking online and in-store demand data could **improve forecasting accuracy**, though this remains an emerging area of study ([

        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9534457/#:~:text=The%20last%20years%E2%80%99%20growth%20in,important%20topic%20in%20retail%20forecasting)). The COVID-19 pandemic provided a stark case study in forecasting challenges: abrupt store closures, stockouts, and shifts in consumer behavior forced retailers to adjust their models. For example, many retailers had to **flag lockdown periods and panic-buying spikes as anomalous**, treating zero-sales during mandated closures or inventory stockouts as “non-informative” data points rather than true zero demand ([
            Post-script—Retail forecasting: Research and practice - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9534457/#:~:text=In%20terms%20of%20forecasting%2C%20the,challenges%20were%20threefold)). These disruptions underscored the need for more flexible forecasting methods that can handle structural breaks and unusual patterns.

At the same time, both industry case studies and academic research emphasize leveraging **big data and advanced analytics** to improve retail forecasts. A comprehensive review of fashion retail forecasting found that the “big data era” is driving a forecasting *revolution* but also **challenging traditional methods**, prompting retailers to adopt new techniques ([Demand forecasting in retail operations for fashionable products: methods, practices, and real case study](https://ideas.repec.org/a/spr/annopr/v291y2020i1d10.1007_s10479-019-03148-8.html#:~:text=investigated%20and%20studied%20in%20the,world%20case)). In that study, Ren *et al.* (2020) conducted a literature survey and then examined how a fashion retailer tackles demand forecasting in practice, highlighting gaps between academic models and real-world needs ([Demand forecasting in retail operations for fashionable products: methods, practices, and real case study](https://ideas.repec.org/a/spr/annopr/v291y2020i1d10.1007_s10479-019-03148-8.html#:~:text=investigated%20and%20studied%20in%20the,world%20case)). Historically, many retailers relied on managers’ intuition for sales projections, but modern analytics aim to reduce this subjectivity. For instance, one study notes that managers often forecast based on personal experience and gut feel, which can vary widely ([

        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9514716/#:~:text=Sales%20forecasting%20and%20effective%20demand,from%20person%20to%20person%20and)). To address this, companies are increasingly deploying **machine learning (ML)** models and automation. A 2024 systematic mapping of over a decade of sales forecasting research confirms a clear shift from basic statistical approaches (e.g. ARIMA or exponential smoothing) to **machine learning and deep learning** methods ([Systematic Mapping Study of Sales Forecasting: Methods, Trends, and Future Directions](https://www.mdpi.com/2571-9394/6/3/28#:~:text=This%20paper%20makes%20substantial%20contributions,comprehensive%20review%20and%20the%20recommendations)). This review also underscores the growing importance of integrating real-time data streams and advanced analytics into forecasting practices to capture changing consumer behavior ([Systematic Mapping Study of Sales Forecasting: Methods, Trends, and Future Directions](https://www.mdpi.com/2571-9394/6/3/28#:~:text=domains%20and%20identifying%20critical%20research,and%20advanced%20analytics%20into%20sales)). In summary, recent evidence shows retail forecasting methodologies evolving toward data-driven, ML-powered approaches, while accounting for new complexities like multi-channel demand and extreme events.

## GDPNow and CBO Projections as Anchors in Economic Forecasting

High-level economic forecasts from institutions are often used as anchors or benchmarks for retail and sectoral forecasting. The Atlanta Fed’s **GDPNow** model, for example, provides real-time (“nowcast”) updates of quarterly GDP growth and is widely followed as an anchor for short-term economic outlooks. According to the Atlanta Fed, GDPNow’s final nowcasts (just before the official GDP release) have an **average absolute error of about 0.77 percentage points**, with a root-mean-square error around 1.15 points ([GDPNow  - Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta](https://www.atlantafed.org/cqer/research/gdpnow#:~:text=Since%20we%20started%20tracking%20GDP,When)). These accuracy metrics cover 2011–2024 and have improved slightly as the model evolved. Overall, the Atlanta Fed notes that GDPNow’s accuracy is *comparable* to that of professional forecasters – it has **not proven significantly more accurate than consensus economist forecasts**, though it does perform well relative to simple statistical models ([GDPNow  - Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta](https://www.atlantafed.org/cqer/research/gdpnow#:~:text=Overall%2C%20these%20accuracy%20metrics%20do,to%20other%20conventional%20statistical%20models)). During the volatile pandemic period, GDPNow (like most forecasters) saw its errors increase substantially, as the model could not fully anticipate the historic swings in activity. Atlanta Fed researchers observed that forecast errors in early 2020 were much larger than pre-2020 norms for all methods, including GDPNow ([PowerPoint Presentation](https://cabe.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/TABE-Webinar-The-Atlanta-Feds-GDPNow-model-during-the-pandemic.pdf#:~:text=11%20The%20black%20crosses%20show,0%205)). However, GDPNow was still more accurate as the quarter-end neared (incorporating more incoming data), and its performance was broadly in line with that of other forecasts (such as the Survey of Professional Forecasters), except in quarters when unpredictable COVID developments caused **across-the-board misses** ([PowerPoint Presentation](https://cabe.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/TABE-Webinar-The-Atlanta-Feds-GDPNow-model-during-the-pandemic.pdf#:~:text=11%20The%20black%20crosses%20show,0%205)). In short, GDPNow serves as a valuable real-time benchmark, but its forecasts are subject to the same uncertainties affecting all economic projections in unusual times.

The **Congressional Budget Office (CBO)** baseline projections likewise act as an anchor for medium-term economic forecasting and budget planning. CBO’s economic forecasts (for growth, inflation, unemployment, etc.) are often the **starting point for federal budget resolutions and policy analysis**, providing a neutral baseline against which policy proposals are measured ([Understanding the CBO Baseline - The Concord Coalition](https://www.concordcoalition.org/primer/understanding-the-cbo-baseline/#:~:text=Understanding%20the%20CBO%20Baseline%20,scoring%20and%20budget%20enforcement)). Many state and federal agencies use CBO’s figures as a consensus foundation for their own forecasts. In terms of accuracy, CBO’s track record has been rigorously evaluated. CBO’s **two-year and five-year macroeconomic projections have been about as accurate as those of other forecasters** (such as the White House Administration and the Blue Chip private-sector consensus) ([CBOâ€™s Economic Forecasting Record: 2019 Update](https://ideas.repec.org/p/cbo/report/55505.html#:~:text=Administration%C3%A2%E2%82%AC%E2%84%A2s%20forecasts%20and%20the%20Blue,forecasters%20made%20similarly%20large%20overestimates)). A 2019 CBO evaluation found that all three sets of forecasts (CBO, Administration, and Blue Chip) showed **very similar error patterns over time** ([CBOâ€™s Economic Forecasting Record: 2019 Update](https://ideas.repec.org/p/cbo/report/55505.html#:~:text=Administration%C3%A2%E2%82%AC%E2%84%A2s%20forecasts%20and%20the%20Blue,forecasters%20made%20similarly%20large%20overestimates)). In other words, when the economy surprised (e.g. a recession or boom that wasn’t fully anticipated), CBO and other forecasters tended to miss in the same direction and magnitude ([CBOâ€™s Economic Forecasting Record: 2019 Update](https://ideas.repec.org/p/cbo/report/55505.html#:~:text=Administration%C3%A2%E2%82%AC%E2%84%A2s%20forecasts%20and%20the%20Blue,forecasters%20made%20similarly%20large%20overestimates)). This suggests CBO’s projections are unbiased and in line with mainstream expectations, making them a reasonable anchor for scenario analysis. They provide a credible baseline, but not a crystal ball – like other forecasts, they can be off when unprecedented events occur. The key value of CBO projections is as a **consistent benchmark** for planning, against which one can evaluate alternative assumptions, rather than as a guarantee of exact outcomes.

## Temporal Disaggregation Techniques: Quarterly Data to Monthly

Temporal disaggregation refers to the process of transforming low-frequency data (quarterly or annual) into higher-frequency estimates (monthly or quarterly) using related indicators or statistical methods. This is important in retail and economic analysis – for instance, converting quarterly GDP or sales figures into monthly series for more timely insights. Traditional approaches include the **Chow-Lin regression method** and the **Denton method** (proportional benchmarking), which have been used by statistical agencies for decades. Recent research has introduced improved techniques and compared their performance. For example, Mosley *et al.* (2022) propose a **“sparse” temporal disaggregation** approach that leverages many auxiliary indicators with regularization (selecting only the most relevant signals). In tests, this sparse method **outperformed classical Chow–Lin methods**, especially when a large number of potential monthly indicators were available ([(PDF) Sparse Temporal Disaggregation - ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/364435335_Sparse_temporal_disaggregation#:~:text=%28PDF%29%20Sparse%20Temporal%20Disaggregation%20,Chow%20and%20Lin%20family%2C)). Another advance comes from state-space modeling: Labonne and Weale (2018) developed a state-space filter to derive **monthly UK business output from quarterly Value-Added Tax (VAT) returns**, which are reported by firms at staggered intervals ([Temporal disaggregation of overlapping noisy quarterly data using state space models: Estimation of monthly business sector output from Value Added Tax data in the UK](https://ideas.repec.org/p/nsr/escoed/escoe-dp-2018-18.html#:~:text=This%20paper%20derives%20monthly%20estimates,compare%20our%20estimates%20with%20those)). Their approach accounts for measurement noise and overlapping quarterly periods. The resulting VAT-based monthly estimates showed a different (smoother and less volatile) trend compared to the official monthly surveys, demonstrating the value of using state-space techniques and administrative data for high-frequency economic monitoring ([Temporal disaggregation of overlapping noisy quarterly data using state space models: Estimation of monthly business sector output from Value Added Tax data in the UK](https://ideas.repec.org/p/nsr/escoed/escoe-dp-2018-18.html#:~:text=seasonally%20adjusted%20figures%20for%20the,The)). These innovations indicate that by using richer information (many indicators or more sophisticated models), one can achieve more accurate or granular monthly estimates than older interpolation methods.

Statistical agencies have also evaluated various disaggregation techniques on real-world data. A 2020 study by Statistics Netherlands compared several methods for converting quarterly VAT-based turnover data into monthly indices ([Discussion paper NL - sjabloon](https://www.cbs.nl/-/media/_pdf/2020/14/nowcasting-fribs-24-maart.pdf#:~:text=figures%20based%20on%20the%20VAT,When%20the%20month%20concerns%20the)). The methods examined included: a **Denton adjustment** approach, a **structural time-series model** (treating missing monthly values for quarterly reporters within a state-space framework), the standard **Chow-Lin** regression method, and an **ARIMA-model-based “bridge” nowcasting** approach (forecasting the quarterly total using monthly sub-series) ([Discussion paper NL - sjabloon](https://www.cbs.nl/-/media/_pdf/2020/14/nowcasting-fribs-24-maart.pdf#:~:text=figures%20based%20on%20the%20VAT,When%20the%20month%20concerns%20the)). Their findings were instructive. No single technique was universally best, but the most effective procedure overall was a *hybrid approach*: first **nowcast the current quarter’s total using an ARIMA bridge model with monthly data as predictors**, then apply the Chow-Lin method to disaggregate that quarterly total into monthly values ([Discussion paper NL - sjabloon](https://www.cbs.nl/-/media/_pdf/2020/14/nowcasting-fribs-24-maart.pdf#:~:text=One%20method%20is%20found%20to,6%20index)). In practice, this meant using the monthly VAT filings that were available to predict the quarter’s outcome, and then distributing that prediction across months in line with historical patterns. This hybrid approach achieved high accuracy – for example, in the hospitality industry case, the real-time monthly estimates were on average only about **1.6 index points off** the “final” figures (obtained later with complete data), well within the acceptable error margin ([Discussion paper NL - sjabloon](https://www.cbs.nl/-/media/_pdf/2020/14/nowcasting-fribs-24-maart.pdf#:~:text=For%20the%20hospitality%20sector%20as,6%20index)). Other methods (including the structural time-series model) also performed well in certain sectors, but the agency chose to implement the **bridge-plus-Chow-Lin method** because it delivered slightly better accuracy while being easier to apply in production ([Discussion paper NL - sjabloon](https://www.cbs.nl/-/media/_pdf/2020/14/nowcasting-fribs-24-maart.pdf#:~:text=Chow%20Lin%20once%20all%20monthly,we%20don%E2%80%99t%20consider%20applying%20them)). This case study highlights that combining **nowcasting with temporal disaggregation** can yield reliable monthly data from quarterly sources, and that practical considerations (like simplicity and data availability) are also important when choosing a method.

## Unit Sales Forecasting Models in Retail: Evaluations and Comparisons

Forecasting at the granular level (such as unit sales per product or per store) is notoriously challenging due to high volatility and large numbers of time series. Recent evaluations have shed light on which models perform best for retail sales forecasting. A major benchmark was the **M5 Forecasting Competition** (2020), which focused on predicting 42,840 hierarchical time series of daily unit sales from Walmart (the world’s largest retailer) ([M5 accuracy competition: Results, findings, and conclusions](https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/intfor/v38y2022i4p1346-1364.html#:~:text=In%20this%20study%2C%20we%20present,the%20implementation%20of%20the%20M5)). The results of M5 highlighted the value of modern machine-learning approaches. Only about **12% of the 5,000+ participating teams** managed to outperform simple baseline models (such as a naïve exponential smoothing benchmark), but the top forecasts achieved up to **20% lower error than the baseline** ([Machine Learning in Retail Forecasting – Results from the M5 Competition | Forecasting Strategy](https://forecasting-strategy.ch/2024/05/16/machine-learning-in-retail-forecasting-results-from-the-m5-competition/#:~:text=The%20teams%E2%80%99%20results%20were%20compared,tackled%20in%20previous%20M%20Competitions)). All of the **winning submissions leveraged pure machine-learning (ML) models**, which **significantly outperformed** traditional statistical methods on this retail data ([Machine Learning in Retail Forecasting – Results from the M5 Competition | Forecasting Strategy](https://forecasting-strategy.ch/2024/05/16/machine-learning-in-retail-forecasting-results-from-the-m5-competition/#:~:text=The%20most%20significant%20methodological%20evolution,technique%20combinations%20proving%20particularly%20effective)). In contrast to the previous M4 competition (where statistical methods were competitive), in M5 every top contender used algorithms like gradient-boosted trees or neural networks, often in complex ensembles. The findings also underlined the efficacy of combining methods: a majority of the top-50 teams used **hybrid ensembles**, blending multiple models (and sometimes incorporating statistical forecasts as features) ([Machine Learning in Retail Forecasting – Results from the M5 Competition | Forecasting Strategy](https://forecasting-strategy.ch/2024/05/16/machine-learning-in-retail-forecasting-results-from-the-m5-competition/#:~:text=The%20most%20significant%20methodological%20evolution,technique%20combinations%20proving%20particularly%20effective)). A new facet in M5 was the success of **“cross-learning”**, i.e. training models across many related time series rather than one series at a time. By pooling information from thousands of products and stores, global ML models could detect cross-sectional patterns and outperform independent models – an approach that was notably effective given the correlations in retail data (e.g. similar products sharing trends) ([Machine Learning in Retail Forecasting – Results from the M5 Competition | Forecasting Strategy](https://forecasting-strategy.ch/2024/05/16/machine-learning-in-retail-forecasting-results-from-the-m5-competition/#:~:text=with%20ML%20and%20statistical%20technique,will%20perform%20on%20new%20data)). In summary, the M5 competition demonstrated that while simple benchmarks are hard to beat across many series, carefully tuned ML techniques (especially ensembles that exploit big data across products) can yield substantial accuracy gains in unit sales forecasting ([Machine Learning in Retail Forecasting – Results from the M5 Competition | Forecasting Strategy](https://forecasting-strategy.ch/2024/05/16/machine-learning-in-retail-forecasting-results-from-the-m5-competition/#:~:text=The%20teams%E2%80%99%20results%20were%20compared,tackled%20in%20previous%20M%20Competitions)) ([Machine Learning in Retail Forecasting – Results from the M5 Competition | Forecasting Strategy](https://forecasting-strategy.ch/2024/05/16/machine-learning-in-retail-forecasting-results-from-the-m5-competition/#:~:text=The%20most%20significant%20methodological%20evolution,technique%20combinations%20proving%20particularly%20effective)). This implies a significant competitive advantage for retailers at the cutting edge of forecasting technology ([Machine Learning in Retail Forecasting – Results from the M5 Competition | Forecasting Strategy](https://forecasting-strategy.ch/2024/05/16/machine-learning-in-retail-forecasting-results-from-the-m5-competition/#:~:text=These%20advancements%20illustrate%20the%20trends,of%20the%20spectrum%20can%20obtain)).

Beyond competitions, academic case studies have similarly found that machine learning ensembles often outperform traditional models for retail sales. For example, Kishore and Kumar (2022) evaluated five different algorithms on a U.S. retail company’s weekly sales data (incorporating features like store size and local temperature) ([
            A Comparative Study of Demand Forecasting Models for a Multi-Channel Retail Company: A Novel Hybrid Machine Learning Approach - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9514716/#:~:text=well%20as%20retail%20companies,LR%20outperformed%20the)). They compared standalone methods – including Random Forest, XGBoost, neural networks, and others – with a combined model that integrated **Random Forest + XGBoost + a linear regression**. The **hybrid ensemble model outperformed all individual models**, achieving the highest accuracy in predicting unit sales ([
            A Comparative Study of Demand Forecasting Models for a Multi-Channel Retail Company: A Novel Hybrid Machine Learning Approach - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9514716/#:~:text=well%20as%20retail%20companies,This%20study%20may)). In fact, the ensemble reduced error metrics below those of even the best single algorithm, illustrating that each technique captured different aspects of the demand signal. The inclusion of external factors (weather and store attributes) also improved forecast accuracy, reflecting the importance of explanatory variables in retail demand. The authors note that such ML-driven forecasting can help retailers optimize inventory and pricing decisions by providing more reliable predictions ([
            A Comparative Study of Demand Forecasting Models for a Multi-Channel Retail Company: A Novel Hybrid Machine Learning Approach - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9514716/#:~:text=%28RF,improve%20the%20methods%20of%20forecasting)). This aligns with the broader industry trend: retailers are increasingly adopting AI/ML forecasting tools (often blending methods and data sources) to **improve unit sales forecasts**, which in turn supports better supply chain and marketing outcomes. Empirical evidence from both competitions and case studies confirms that, in the retail sector, advanced forecasting models – especially **ensemble and hybrid approaches – consistently outperform naïve or single-model forecasts** in terms of accuracy ([
            A Comparative Study of Demand Forecasting Models for a Multi-Channel Retail Company: A Novel Hybrid Machine Learning Approach - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9514716/#:~:text=well%20as%20retail%20companies,This%20study%20may)) ([Machine Learning in Retail Forecasting – Results from the M5 Competition | Forecasting Strategy](https://forecasting-strategy.ch/2024/05/16/machine-learning-in-retail-forecasting-results-from-the-m5-competition/#:~:text=The%20most%20significant%20methodological%20evolution,technique%20combinations%20proving%20particularly%20effective)). Key takeaways are that incorporating diverse data (e.g. promotions, weather, web traffic) and using a mixture of modeling techniques can markedly enhance the precision of retail sales forecasts, helping businesses navigate demand uncertainty with greater confidence.
