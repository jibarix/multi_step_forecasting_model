# Revised Implementation Plan: Hybrid Approach

## 1. GDP-Anchored Variable Modeling System

### A. Dimension Reduction Framework
- Implement PCA module for economic indicators
- Create variable clustering using hierarchical methods
- Develop transformation pipeline (raw variables → reduced space)

### B. Model Training Pipeline
- Build GDP-to-principal-component models
- Implement cluster-based modeling (one model per cluster)
- Create individual models for key indicators
- Develop evaluation system to select best approach per variable

### C. Temporal Disaggregation
- Implement Chow-Lin and Denton methods
- Create GDP quarterly-to-monthly conversion workflow
- Build validation metrics for disaggregated series

## 2. Target Variable Prediction System

### A. Feature Selection Framework
- Create evaluator for individual variables vs. PCA components
- Implement forward/backward selection for target model
- Design cross-validation specific to time series forecasting

### B. Model Factory Enhancements
- Expand LightGBM implementation (key winner from M5)
- Add ensemble techniques with variable weighting
- Implement model persistence and versioning

## 3. Forecast Generation Pipeline

### A. GDP Projection Handler
- Build parser for user GDP inputs (2025.1: -1.8 format)
- Create validation and error handling for inputs
- Implement horizon determination logic

### B. Multi-stage Forecast Engine
- Develop workflow: GDP projections → anchored variables → target
- Implement confidence interval calculation
- Create hierarchical reconciliation for consistent forecasts

## 4. Command Interface and Utilities

### A. Model Management Commands
- Add command to update GDP-anchored models independently
- Create target model selection/training command
- Build model inspection and diagnostics utilities

### B. Forecast Generation Interface
- Develop forecast command with GDP projection inputs
- Create visualization tools for scenario comparison
- Implement export functionality (CSV, Excel, JSON)

This hybrid approach allows the system to leverage dimensionality reduction while maintaining flexibility in the target model's variable selection process.
